# Storybook Component Testing

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is a tool for developing UI components in isolation. It is a great way to develop and test components in isolation. It is also a great way to document components. This project is a simple example of how to use Storybook to develop and test components.

[Play functions](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/play-function) can be added to these stories to test the components. The Storybook [test runner](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-tests/test-runner) can be used to run these as tests.
